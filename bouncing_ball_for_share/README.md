# Learning Hybrid Control Barrier Functions from Data - Bouncing Ball Case Study

Code for the bouncing ball case study in "Learning Hybrid Control Barrier Functions from Data".

## Getting Started

1. Simply run the blocks top-down to reproduce our results
2. Upload the training data: X_train_cts.npy, U_train_cts.npy in the [data](https://github.com/unstable-zeros/learning-hcbfs/tree/main/bouncing_ball_for_share/data) folder (optional)
3. Upload the learned HCBF: params.npy in the [network](https://github.com/unstable-zeros/learning-hcbfs/tree/main/bouncing_ball_for_share/network) folder (optional)


### Prerequisites

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) recommended for running the code.
